CMSI 4072 project ~ Spring 2024
Anna Garren and Erin Hurlburt
FlickPick project
==============================

Proposal Document:
------------------
   Good work on the proposal document, although not having a file extention
   like '.txt' or something I kinda had to wing it.  I got it though...
   The description is very complete and documents the way the user will run
   the application quite well.

   In the justification section, you talk about web development and stress
   the challenging nature of the project being balance with your self-
   reflectiveness of knowing your own limitations of putting the project
   together.  I agree: 'win-win'!

Proposal Presentation:
----------------------
   Nice job on the presentation!  Making the slides look like a theater was
   a great idea ~ eye-catching and a good way to highlight your work.  You
   did well describing your project, and you engaged the audience and made
   good eye contact.  You answered the questions well, too.

Great job on this presentation and proposal and great start to the semester!
