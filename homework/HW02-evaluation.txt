Comments:
---------
Nice work on this assignment.

On 5.2, and interesting idea using a rule-based architecture for tic-tac-toe
when usually that is the kind of architecture for an 'expert system' that is
best for diagnostic or decision tree systems.  Still several people have
used that in their answers and it makes sense enough that I'm going to try
to implement it for my CMSI 627 class as an example...

On 5.4, again, a rule-based system is not referring to the fact that there
are rules to a game that must be followed when playing.  If you read the
text carefully, it explains that these are more for 'troubleshooting' types
of systems.  The client/server architecture you mention is probably better
for this one.

Lovely job on the diagrams!

Good job!!
