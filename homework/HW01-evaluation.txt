problem 4.4 you are starting your schedule on Thursday when the problem states
   that January 1 is a WEDNESDAY.  That makes your ending date one day late.
   In the 'real world' you'll need to mark the months and dates as well as
   the days of the week ~ just sayin'....

problem 5.3 although a good case could be made for your selections, actually
   the options should be categorized as:
      User: b, c, d, l, m, n, o, p
      Business: a
      Functional: b, c, d, j, k, l, m, n, o, p
      Non-functional: e, f, g, h, i
      Implementation: empty

problem 5.9 I think you may have missed the intent of this problem.  It is
   asking you to come up with MORE things to add or to change and then to
   prioritize the additions/changes using MoSCoW.  You just re-stated the
   items that are already there.

Nice work on this assignment! Keep up the good work...
