Software Requirements Specification Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- Introduction Section
   It would be helpful to have some sort of introduction to the document, to
   make sure that the reader knows some context for the user stories.  It
   doesn't have to be extensive, just a very high-level overview.

-- Functional Requirements
   This entire section is WONDERFUL!!  You two did a great job on these, and
   your document is the first one in the list that actually used the Agile
   requirements process!  I'm very VERY impressed.

-- Performance Requirements
   It would be good to have at least a couple of performance requirements to
   specify some non-functional things that your application must do.  For
   example, how long do you estimate the user will have to wait for results?

-- Environment Requirements
   This would be a very useful section to fill in, even if it's not in the
   Agile format, just so that people will know what is needed to develop and
   to deploy the application.  Even if it is designed to operate in a web
   browser, it's helpful to know that fact.

=============================================================================
your score:  9% out of 10% which is an A-minus

All in all, a GREAT first effort, you just need to fill in more specifics.

Make the changes as suggested above, including many more requirements for
the second submission and you'll get the full 10% on this document.
