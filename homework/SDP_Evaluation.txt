FlickPick project

Software Development Plan Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- General Comments
   This is an awesome job, ladies!  You have really done excellent work on
   the document.  Nice bullet list in the deliverables section...

-- Introduction Section
   This section is intended to reflect not just the deliverable items from
   the documentation but also the 'deliverables' that are actual project
   work products.  However, you have that information elsewhere in your
   document, so no need to duplicate it.  All good!

-- Project Resources Section
   Perfect ~ no further comments, nothing to add for the second submission.

-- Project Organization Section
   Perfect ~ no further comments, nothing to add for the second submission.

-- Project Schedule Section
   Perfect ~ no further comments, nothing to add for the second submission.

=============================================================================
your score:  10% out of 10% which is an A-plus

You are good to go.  Full credit for both the first and second submission.
